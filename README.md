Generate solid model in Siemens NX using .gcode file!

.Stl file can be easily downloaded in Internet. But currently there is no good way to convert a .stl file to a total same solid model in CAD software. In order to re-edit the .stl model, we must find a compromise method to build a similar model in CAD-software although it is no perfect.

The ideal is: .stl --> .gcode --> build the model layer by layer just like a 3D printer

Software I used:
  - Cura 4.3.0
  - Siemens NX 12.0
  - Visual Studio 2019
